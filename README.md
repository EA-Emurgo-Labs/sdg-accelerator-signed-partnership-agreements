# 📄 SDG Accelerator – Signed Partnership Agreements

This repository contains signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs), Letters of Intent (LOIs), and Partnership Agreements established as part of the EMURGO x UNDP Blockchain Accelerator. These documents provide formal evidence of collaboration between accelerator participants and relevant stakeholders—including governments, NGOs, private sector entities, and blockchain infrastructure partners.

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to transparently document and archive all signed partnership agreements to:

- Demonstrate ecosystem engagement and validation for participating teams
- Support Milestone 3 (M3) submissions with verifiable proofs of collaboration
- Facilitate accountability and traceability across project partnerships
- Build trust with current and future stakeholders


Each team folder should contain:
- A clear and signed agreement file (PDF preferred)
- A descriptive filename including the partner's name and document type

## 📝 Submission Guidelines

1. **Format:** All documents should be in PDF format and signed by both parties.
2. **Naming Convention:** Use `[PartnerName]_[DocumentType].pdf`, e.g., `UNDP_MoU.pdf`.
3. **Location:** Place documents in your team’s designated subfolder.
4. **Confidentiality:** If any agreements contain sensitive terms, please redact accordingly or seek written permission before publishing publicly.

## 🔐 Access and Verification

These agreements will be reviewed by the program administrators and may be used to assess the credibility and maturity of project partnerships for demo day and post-accelerator grant consideration.

## 🤝 Why This Matters

Robust partnerships are essential to the success of SDG-aligned blockchain solutions. These agreements reflect the tangible progress each team has made in engaging real-world stakeholders and committing to collaborative development.
